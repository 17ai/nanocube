# Nanocubes: an in-memory data structure for spatiotemporal data cubes

Nanocubes are a fast data structure for in-memory data cubes developed
at the
[Information Visualization department](http://www.research.att.com/infovis)
at [AT&T Labs â€“ Research](http://www.research.att.com). Visualizations
powered by nanocubes can be used to explore datasets with billions of
elements at interactive rates in a web browser, and in some cases nanocubes
uses sufficiently little memory that you can run a nanocube in a
modern-day laptop.

## Compiling the latest release

**Prerequisites**

1. The nanocubes server is 64-bit only.  There is NO support on 32-bit operating systems.
2. The nanocubes server is written in C++ 11.  You must use a recent version of gcc (>= 4.7.2).
3. The nanocubes server uses [Boost](http://www.boost.org).  You must use version 1.48 or later.
4. To build the nanocubes server, you must have the [GNU build system](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) installed.

On a newly installed 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 system, gcc/g++ is already 4.8.2, but you may have to install the following packages:

    $ sudo apt-get install automake
    $ sudo apt-get install libtool
    $ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev

Example installation on Mac OS 10.9 Maverick with a local homebrew:

	$git clone https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew.git

Set your path to use this local homebrew				

	$export PATH=${PWD}/homebrew/bin:${PATH}

Install the packages (This assumed your g++ has been installed by [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/))

	brew install boost libtool autoconf automake

Set path to the boost directory

	export BOOST_ROOT=${PWD}/homebrew

Run the following commands to compile nanocubes on your linux/mac system. Replace `X.X.X`
with valid release numbers (e.g. 2.1.1, 2.1, 2.0).

    $ wget https://github.com/laurolins/nanocube/archive/X.X.X.zip
    $ unzip X.X.X.zip
    $ cd nanocube-X.X.X
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If a recent version of gcc is not the default, you can run `configure`
with the specfic recent version of gcc in your system. For example

    $ CXX=g++-4.8 ./configure

If your system has tcmalloc installed, we suggest linking nanocubes with it.
For example

    $ CXX=g++-4.8 ./configure LIBS=<path-to-tcmalloc>/libtcmalloc_minimal.a

## Loading a CSV file into a nanocube

1. For compiling our python helper code, you will need the following packages:

        $ sudo apt-get install python-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install gfortran

2. Install the python data analysis library (pandas) in a separate python environment (Recommended)

        $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv/virtualenv-1.11.4.tar.gz
        $ tar xfz virtualenv-1.11.4.tar.gz
        $ python virtualenv-1.11.4/virtualenv.py  myPy
        
        # activate the virtualenv, type "deactivate" to disable the env when done
        $ source myPy/bin/activate
        $ pip install argparse numpy pandas

3. Start a web server in the "web" directory and send it to background.  If port 8000 is already being used
on your system, please choose another port.

        $ cd web
        $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &

4. Run the script and pipe it to the nanocubes server using the
   included example dataset
   ([Chicago Crime](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2)).  If port 29512 is already
   being used on your system, please choose another port.  Note that the port is specified for both the python script and for
   the nanocubes server (ncserve). If these are not the same, you'll run into problems.  29512 is the default value, so if you
   don't specify the port at all, it will try to use the default.

        $ cd ../scripts
        $ python csv2Nanocube.py --timecol='Date' --latcol='Latitude' --loncol='Longitude' --catcol='Primary Type' --port=29512 crime50k.csv | NANOCUBE_BIN=../src  ../src/ncserve --rf=10000 --threads=100 --port=29512



   The first few lines of the example dataset are shown below. The first line is a header, which describes each of the columns in this table of data.
   You should notice that there are columns called: Date, Primary Type, Latitude, Longitude.  These are the columns used for this visualization.

        ID,Case Number,Date,Block,IUCR,Primary Type,Description,Location Description,Arrest,Domestic,Beat,District,Ward,Community Area,FBI Code,X Coordinate,Y Coordinate,Year,Updated On,Latitude,Longitude,Location

   The parameters for csv2Nanocube.py are listed below.  Note that when we called the script above, we only specified the categorical dimension (Primary Type), but not the Date, Latitude, or Longitude.  The script is smart enough to identify these columns automatically if they have these names.  If they were named differently (e.g. date, lat, long), we would have to use the other parameters for the script (--timecol, --latcol, --loncol) to identify them for the script.  If your data is also separated by a character other than a comma, you can indicate this when you run the script using the '--sep' parameter.

        --catcol='Column names of categorical variable'
        --latcol='Column names of latitude'
        --loncol='Column names of longitude'
        --countcol='Column names of the count'
        --timecol='Column names of the time variable'
        --timebinsize='time bin size in seconds(s) minutes(m) hours(h) days(D)'
        --port='Port of the nanocubes server'
        --sep='Delimiter of Columns'
        e.g. 1D/30m/60s'

   The output generated by running the csv2Nanocube.py script should look like the following.
   You can see that 49,186 points were inserted into the nanocube, which is using 49MB of RAM.

5. That's it.  Point your browser (Firefox, Chrome) to http://localhost:8000 for the viewer. If you needed to change the port number in Step 3 above, make sure that you specify the same number here.

6. If you believe there may be a problem, try running 'nctest.sh' in the scripts subdirectory.  It will make some queries of the nanocube (change the script if you are not using port 29512) and compare the results to known results that we gathered ourselves.  If the results match, it will report 'SUCCESS'.

7. When finished, terminate the nanocube (e.g. Control-C) and then type 'deactivate' on the command-line to shut the virtual python environment down.

For this example we assume you are running everything on your
localhost. Modify `config.json` accordingly in the `web` folder for
different setups.

### Subsequent Runs

Running this example again later, you do not need to reinstall the linux or python packages.

        $ cd nanocube-X.X.X
        $ source myPy/bin/activate
        $ cd web
        $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &
        $ cd ../scripts
        $ python csv2Nanocube.py --catcol='Primary Type' --port=29512 crime50k.csv | NANOCUBE_BIN=../src  ../src/ncserve --rf=10000 --threads=100 --port=29512


## Further Details

For a better understanding on how to ingest data into nanocubes and
how to query nanocubes follow this
[link](https://github.com/laurolins/nanocube/wiki). For larger
datasets or if you want more flexibility on ingesting/querying data
using nanocubes the CSV loading method illustrated above might not be
the most efficient way to go.
